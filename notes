
1. index.html
# Purpose:
  - This is your main entry page — the first thing visitors see.

# It has:
  - The Start link (which triggers the birthday sequence).
  - Two cat images (initially off-screen).
  - Hidden birthday cake preview.
  - References to your scripts (script.js) and styles (style.css).

# Think of it as:
  - The storyboard of the first scene — it lays out where everything goes but doesn’t decide how it moves or looks.

---

2. script.js
# Purpose:
  - This is the logic and interaction for index.html.

# It handles:
  - What happens when the Start link is clicked (music, confetti, cat animation).
  - When to show the “Happy Birthday” bubbles.
  - When to reveal the cake and enable the “Cake” button.
  - Redirecting the user to the cake.html page (with their name).

# Think of it as:
  - The director — it tells the actors (cats, text, music) when and how to move.

---

3. style.css
# Purpose:
  - This is your styling file.

# It defines:
  - Position and size of cats, bubbles, and cake.
  - Backgrounds, colors, and text appearance.
  - Responsive adjustments for PC and phone modes.

# Think of it as:
  - The costume and set designer — it makes everything look good and in the right place.

---

4. cake.html
# Purpose:
  - This is the second page — shown when the user clicks the Cake button on index.html.

# It has:
  - A cake image with candles.
  - A header for “HAPPY BIRTHDAY {NAME}” (hidden at first).
  - Instructions for blowing out the candles.
  - Loads cake.js to handle the microphone and candle blowing detection.

# Think of it as:
  - The second scene in the story — the big candle-blowing moment.

---

5. cake.js
# Purpose:
  - This is the logic for cake.html.
# It does:
  - Get the user’s name from the URL.
  - Listen to the microphone for a loud enough sound (blowing).
  - If the sound is detected: 
    - Change the cake image to one without candles.
    - Show the “HAPPY BIRTHDAY {NAME}” header.
    - Trigger confetti.
    - Stop listening to the mic.

# Think of it as:
  - The special effects crew — it listens for the “blow” cue and triggers the big reveal.


index.html loads → script.js waits for Start click.
You click Start → music + confetti + cats + bubbles + cake button.
Click Cake → redirects to cake.html with your name in the URL.
cake.html loads → cake.js listens to mic.
You blow → candles go out + confetti + “Happy Birthday {NAME}” appears.

-------------------------------------------
THE CONCEPT:

a cat feels like everyone forget about its birthday. no one even greeted the cat as it keeps on doing its same routine, not until someone accompany it then lead that cat to a surprise party.

everyone do feel the birthday blues, where they think they dont matter, their existence isn't valued by others. but there is always that someone who will make you feel like everything isn't about the way you think. Everyone has this one someone who would make you feel like you matter even though you feel like you want to give up the world. what you only need to do is to chin up and notice that person who cared for you and wanted to care for you for the rest of their life

help me create a birthday website.

the idea:
HBD.com - name of the url link 

main page - has button (TEXT LINK WITH UNDERLINE / ANCHOR TEXT: Start) also add the main page.png
When main page button (Start) is pressed on kindly ask user for their name as this name will be written on the HAPPY BIRTHDAY {NAME}-which is the last part and add another page for the images i have which are the:
1.png
2.png
3.png
4.png
5.png
6.png
7.png

note: this images must be played for 10 seconds each, also add this music while playing the images. this is the music title (when i walk with you - jazzer).
while for this image (8.png), if this image was played stop the music title (when i walk with you - jazzer) and add the pop up confetti for surprise, also add another music which is the (happy birthday to you instrumental). also on the lower part add another button (TEXT LINK WITH UNDERLINE / ANCHOR TEXT: Make a Wish)
 
Once the button (TEXT LINK WITH UNDERLINE / ANCHOR TEXT: Make a Wish) is pressed show another page wherein it has a whole cake for user to blow. when they blow the screen the candle will turn off. then the HAPPY BIRTHDAY {NAME} will be the header where it will only show up when the user blow the candle
